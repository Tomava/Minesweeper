# Minesweeper
 
This is a classic game known as Minesweeper where the goal is to clear the play
area of safe squares. If a square with a mine is clicked, the game ends.
Left click reveals a square (safe or mine) and right click adds a flag to
square which prevents accidentally clicking on it.
Empty squares will reveal all adjacent empty squares and border squares just
like in the original game. Also clicking on an already revealed square will
reveal adjacent squares if there are a right number of flags around it. This
will fail the game if flags are in incorrect positions.
The number on the top left shows how many mines there are left and the number
on top right shows how many safe squares are unrevealed. The spinbox on the top
can be used to adjust the amount of mines.
